- malloc() doesnâ€™t directly go ahead and ask the OS for memory, that would be too slow. Instead there are various caches for memory blocks of varying sizes. So this is what allocator takes care of. A language may not have a runtime, but would have a allocator for sure. Runtime may have GC, etc. Tho storing chunks of memory allocated and metadata related to it is a very fundamental operation required by all  languages.
