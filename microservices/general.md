- If you follow pattern of different DB for each microservice, then one of the problems we face is around foreign key relations when it's needed across DBs and hence you would have to manually maintain and verify them, e.g. In Dyte, we had livestreaming-ms which needed foreign key relations with organization table, but we couldn't do it.
	- Now let's say if you have a jobs ( recording jobs running in workers ) oriented service like in Dyte we have recording, we would ideally not want two separate DBs for both microservice and job ( that would not make any sense ). So we need one DB for both job and microservice. One solution here is to send callbacks via REST API from job to microservice, this is what we did in `recording`, but let's imagine a scenario where data is much higher in quantity than recording. Here REST APIs can choke, so we can make job access the database directly. But then we are rewriting DB logic both in microservice and job separately, to avoid this, we can follow a monorepo structure between job and microservice, where we share the code but they both are deployed as different entities at the end of the day.

- If you have a service which receives requests which are not time critical to execute ( time critical = if request is not served now there's no use, i.e. retries are useless ), i.e. we can retry the same request later, a good example for such a service is webhooks/dispute APIs, etc.
	- These services are susceptible to sudden spikes, which only occur occasionally, but when they do, they can take down the system.
	- To solve this we can add exponential backoff to the retry time, tho this may still not be the solution cause all the failed ones are grouped together for the same timespan, which can bring down the service again, so what we do is we add some jitter ( randomness when calculating the next retry time ) along side exponential backoff time
