## Learnings
- If you are coding something complicated, try to make something which gives you some good visual feedback very early on
- Try to record yourself whenever you do code. Try to keep speaking whatever comes to your mind. It will be fascinating the amount of things you will learn just by watching yourself, you don't need to show it to outside world, just watch yourself.
