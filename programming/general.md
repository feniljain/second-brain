- Autochrome and difftastic represent diffing as a **shortest path problem** on a directed acyclic graph. [ Source: https://www.wilfred.me.uk/blog/2022/09/06/difftastic-the-fantastic-diff/ ] #diffing #graphs
- There's a type of hashing where hashing is locality-sensitive ( = similar inputs will receive similar hash function outputs ), and it's known as Perceptual Hashing
	- For reverse image search Canva built, they used pHash ( popular perceptual hash function ) and hamming distance to find the difference between two images

 - Duck Typing
	 - If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it is a duck!
		 - Now it may also be a human walking like duck and making duck noises, we don't care!
	 - e.g. If something has `pop` and `push` methods, we will consider it a stack
		 - This is keeping in mind that we only define interface of stack to be these two methods.
		 - So a dummy impl pushing and popping even a constant in stack is a stack
