- Going through files with startup order as listed in https://htr3n.github.io/2018/07/faster-zsh/
	- Found `. "$HOME/.cargo/env"`, seemed useful didn't touch it
	- Then checked `.zshlogin`, found rvm load script, uninstalled rvm and removed that
- Removing not used exports
- Converting nvm export to be lazy-loaded using function, it took my init time from ~0.5-0.6s to ~0.1s

- Tried converting ghcup same way, but ran in into recursive functions somehow
- Another nice chunk shaved was disabling auto-update checks omz does everything, it reduced time from ~0.1s to 0.08s
- Making `compinit` not check for config updates everytime, and instead just once in a day seemed kinda dicey, so didn't go ahead with that
- Removing `battery` and `git` plugin helped reduce more 0.01s, so now we are at 0.07s
