- Execution of a C program doesn't start at `main()`, it actually starts at `_start()`
- Character Devices: Unix supports 'device files', which aren't really files at all, but file-like access points to hardware devices. A 'character' device is one which is interfaced byte-by-byte (as opposed to buffered IO).
- The following are the manual's section numbers and the types of pages they contain:
	1. Executable programs or shell commands
	2. System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
	3. Library calls (functions within program libraries)
	4. Special files (usually found in /dev)
