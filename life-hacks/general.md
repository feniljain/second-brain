	- Body enters "fight or flight" mode which causes prefrontal cortex, which is the hub for rational thinking, to stop working. We need to get it back on track.
	- One way to do that is `Breathe`, count inhale and exhale upto 6 or 10. Feel the air going down your nose to throat and further.
	- `Focus on your body`, don't sit still, that may tense up your body, try to take a small walk, if that is not possible any activity like crossing your fingers, or feeling the ground under your feet should do
	- `Try saying a mantra`, eg.s in article:
		- "Go to neutral"
		- "This isn't about me"
		- "This will pass"
		- "This is about the business"
	- `Acknowledge and label your feelings`, better explained in article ig
	- `Take a break`, don't make it seem like you want to escape the situation, instead keep the walkaways natural and give yourself some think to cool down and think.
	- Don't tell the opposite person these tips while having the discussion, no one would want to be taught in this situation, instead take a bite and let the other person vent. It would be hard to not vent back, you can visualize word going over your shoulders instead of going to the the body, this can help in keeping your calm. Be sure to not seem aloof while doing this.

	 - Quick summary:
		 - **Binaural Beats** - There are playlists available on YouTube (or free apps if you google) that will play Binaural Beats (where you listen to two tones with slightly different frequencies at the same time). 40 Hz binaural beats have been shown to improve focus, attention and memory retention in a number of peer reviewed studies. _Huberman recommends listening to 5-10 minutes of Binaural Beats prior to when you start your task to make it easier to get into a state of flow._
		- **90 Minutes** - The ideal duration for focused sessions is 90 minutes or less. Past that, fatigue begins to set in and the amount of focus people are able to dedicate begins to drop off. Therefore, _Huberman sets a timer for 90 minutes when he begins a focused task and stops after that_.
		- **Defocus** - After the 90 minutes (or less) focus session, you should spend 10-20 minutes where you deliberately _defocus_ and give your brain/body a chance to rest. During this time, you should avoid focusing on any single thing (_so avoid using your phone_) and can work on menial tasks where your mind can wander (talk a short walk, do the dishes, wash the laundry, etc.). This is the best way to recharge for the next 90 minute focus session after the break. 
		-Â **Visual Field** - A great deal of our cognitive focus is directed by our visual system. If you focus your eyes on a pen, you'll naturally start to focus on it and notice details about the pen. Cognitive focus tends to follow overt visual focus. Therefore, you can help ease yourself into a focused state by picking something in your room (part of the wall, an object, etc.) and staring at that object for 30 seconds to a few minutes (blinking is fine, don't try to force your eyes open). This helps you get into a focused state, and you can redirect your focus to your task after the 30 seconds is up.
