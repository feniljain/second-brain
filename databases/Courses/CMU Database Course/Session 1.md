- record = tuple = one table row
- Relation: Defines relationship between different attributes (=columns) of different entities (=tables)
- n-ary Relation = Table with n columns
- Some databases treat your primary key as just a unique constraint, and instead generate and store their own primary keys under the hood, e.g. sqlite
- Foreign Key: An attribute that specifics relationship from itself to another tuple(s) in another relation
- Relation Algebra Operations:
	- Select
	- Projection
	- Union
	- Intersection
	- Difference
	- Product
	- Join
- Select operation directly relates to `WHERE` clause in SQL
- Projection operation directly relates to `SELECT` clause in SQL
- Union operation directly relates to `UNION` clause in SQL
- Intersection operation directly relates to `INTERSECT` clause in SQL
- Difference operation directly relates to `EXCEPT` clause in SQL
- Product operation directly relates to `CROSS JOIN` clause in SQL
- Join operation directly relates to `JOIN` clause in SQL
