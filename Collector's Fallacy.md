# Collector's Fallacy

Today I read about collector's fallacy, it was an interesting topic, because I personally related to it a lot. I have a kb which I maintain [here](https://github.com/feniljain/knowledge-base)

And I have been getting the feeling lately that I am just filling links in my kb, I tend to read almost all of the links but still I just forget a lot of stuff I want to recollect all the time.

So I read [this](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/) article and I have decided to change this. This is one of the reasons I have shifted to `obsidian` . I hope to make a shift in my habit around collector's fallacy.

## What is collector's fallacy?

In simple terms, it is pseudo-satisfaction which one gets just by collecting links, though not actually working towards preserving the information in your head by note-taking/timely revision.

## How to overcome it (Possible solution)?
We will follow something called `Knowledge Cycle` to overcome it:
- Research for one hour and no more. Process all the information gathered in this one hour and then only proceed.
- Do a quick review of the cycle: How did it go? What new did you learn? Was the time span enough for you?
- Change the time constraint as suitable

 Strike the perfect balance till it hits the sweet spot to your likeness.
