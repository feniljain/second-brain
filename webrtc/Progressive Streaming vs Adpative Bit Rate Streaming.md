# Progressive VS ABR Streaming
Progressive Streaming is where a single video file is being streamed over to the client. The video will automatically expand or contract according to the screen size, you can see one of the problems already: it may cause the video to pixelate/get stretched. Another problem is giving same resolution of video to each and every user is fine until it is low resolution, the moment it is streamed as a high resolution video, it causes problems for users with slow internet. This causes a lot of buffering issues.

Adaptive BitRate Streaming streams different videos for each screen size it targets. They are also encoded in multiple resolutions. Now the best middle ground is found where there is no buffering and highest possible quality(for each consumer), and streamed accordingly.
